# BatchUtilites
General Windows utilities in a simple batch file. Currently contains a few troll features, but I plan to add more in the future.
I will upload a .bat version of the file for the source code along with a compiled .exe.
I made this as beginner project in my IT class and is in no way meant to be used for everyday tasks or to be expected to work 100% of the time.

**You can find the .bat and the compiled .exe file under releases. I have to add this because people are stupid and never check releases.

!!!WARNING!!! Be careful with the troll features, they can seriously mess up your computer. Try to only use in a VM or trash computer.

Have a nice day!





** No, I'm probably not updating this
