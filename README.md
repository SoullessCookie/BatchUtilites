# BatchUtilites
General Windows utilities in a simple batch file. Currently contains a few troll features, but I plan to add more in the future.
I will upload a .bat version of the file for the source code along with a compiled .exe.
I made this as beginner project in my IT class and is in no way meant to be used for everyday tasks or to be expected to work 100% of the time.

!!!WARNING!!! Be careful with the troll features, they can seriously mess up your computer. Try to only use in a VM or trash computer.

Have a nice day!
